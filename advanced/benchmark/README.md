# Benchmarking and Profiling

## Profiling

**Profiling** is the technique that allows us to pinpoint the most resource-intensive spots in an  application. 
A **profiler** is a program that runs an application and monitors how long each function takes to execute, thus 
detecting the functions in which your application spends most of its time.

**Benchmarks** are small scripts used to asscess the total execution time of your application.

Tools to use
- `matplotlib`
- `pytest`
- `pytest-benchmark`
- `line-profiler`
- `psutil`
- `memory-profiler`
