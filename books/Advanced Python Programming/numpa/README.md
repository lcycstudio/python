# Fast Array Operations with Numpy and Pandas

NumPy is the de facto standard for scientific computing in Python. It extends Python with a flexible multidimensional
array that allows fast and concise mathematical calculations. 
Pandas is a tool that relies heavily on NumPy and provides additional data structures and algorithms targeted toward
data analysis. 

The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:
- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays
- Mastering NumPy's broadcasting feature for fast and succinct
  vectorized operations
- Improving our particle simulator with NumPy
- Reaching optimal performance with numexpr
- Pandas fundamentals
- Database-style operations with Pandas
