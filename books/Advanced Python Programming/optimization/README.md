# Pure Python Optimzations

One of the most effective ways of improving the performance of applications is through the use of better algorithms and data structures. 
We will understand how to achieve better scaling using standard algorithms and data structures.

The list of topics to be covered in this chapter is as follows:
- Introduction to computational complexity
- Lists and deques
- Dictionaries
- How to build an inverted index using a dictionary
- Sets
- Heaps and priority queues
- Implementing autocompletion using tries
- Introduction to caching
- In-memory caching with the functools.lru_cache decorator
- On-disk cache with joblib.Memory
- Fast and memory-efficient loops with comprehensions and generators
