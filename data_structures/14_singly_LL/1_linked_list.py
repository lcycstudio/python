What is a linked list?

A linked list is a form of a sequential collection and it does not have to be in order.
A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each
node has a reference to the next node in the link.

Head: a train's head
Cars: nodes
Tail: a train's tail 
- Each car is independent
- Cars: passengers and links (nodes: data and links)

[Head|001] [1|111] [2|222] [4|333] [5|null]
            001     111     222     333
