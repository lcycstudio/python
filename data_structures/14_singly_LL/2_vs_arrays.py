Linked Lists vs Arrays

Linked List = [Head|001] [1|111] [2|222] [4|333] [5|null]

Array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Elements of linked lists are independent objects
- Variable size: the size of a linked list is not predefined
- Insertion and removals in Linked List are very efficient
- Random access - accessing an element is very efficient in arrays
