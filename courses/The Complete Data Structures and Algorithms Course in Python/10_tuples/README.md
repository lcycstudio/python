### What is a Tuple? How to create it?

A tuple is an immutable sequence of Python objects.

Tuples are also comparable and hashable.

```python
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```


### Time and Space complexity of Tuples

| **Operation**             | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Creating a Tuple          | O(1)                | O(n)                 |
| Traversing a given Tuple  | O(n)                | O(1)                 |
| Accessing a given element | O(1)                | O(1)                 |
| Searching a given element | O(n)                | O(1)                 |
